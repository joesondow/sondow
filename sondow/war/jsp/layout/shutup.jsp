                    Shutup is a lightning talk timer application written in JavaFX. 
                    At the Java Posse Roundup 2009 a bunch of us iteratively designed and 
                    coded the application as an exercise in JavaFX. It proved so useful
                    during our lightning talks that we continued to enhance it for the 
                    <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/JavaPosseRoundup/">Java
                    Posse Roundup 2010</a>.

                    When the time runs out, a several sounds play, including the authors of
                    the application yelling "Shut up!" as a group.
